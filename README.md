# Orbit

## What is this?
Orbit is a Minecraft mod designed to expand your Minecraft world into the Atmosphere (and beyond?) and let you take controll of the final frontier with Orbitals. Want to generate near-infinite FE? Want to rain destruction down upon your foes? Want to stop others from raining destruction down on you? This is where you start.
